## Introduction

Quarter Life (QL) is a first-person adventure game and my personal side project. The underlying engine is Unreal (version 4.12.5). My inspiration comes from Half Life 2, Portal 1/2, Bioshock 1/2, Prey (2017), Witcher 3, Shadow Warrior 1/2, Unreal Tournament, Doom (2016) and Doom 3, Quake Champions.

Game elements currently being implemented include
+ Weapon
    + Gravity gun as in Half life 2.
    + Portal gun as in Portal 2, despite technically not a seamless portal as in the original Portal game.
+ Super power
    + Mimic Matter as in Prey (2017), letting player morph into physical objects.
    + Za Warudo (the world) as in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, stopping time for a short period.

This git repo contains C++ source codes that establish the main game mechanics. The blueprint scripts and game data are not included. The use of blueprint scripts is kept to the minimum.
